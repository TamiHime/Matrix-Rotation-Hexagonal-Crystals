# Matrix-Rotation-Hexagonal-Crystals
The Python code I wrote and used to compute the resolved stresses in an epitaxial layer of Ruthenium.

As part of an in-class assignment, I used my knowledge of crystallography and the data derived from the publication *Katayun Barmak et al (2020) https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0015188* to calculate the following:

- Strain in the hexagon and rotated honeycomb (see image below).
- Resolved shear stress for the slip systems and twinning modes.
